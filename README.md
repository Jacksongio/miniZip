# miniZip
miniZip is a minimal C ZIP archiver powered by zlib, reverse-engineered from WinZip’s compression logic. This lightweight CLI tool demonstrates writing local file headers, compressing data, assembling the central directory, and finalizing with the End of Central Directory record—an ideal hands-on ZIP guide.
